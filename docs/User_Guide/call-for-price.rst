Call for Price
==============

Overview
````````

Nowadays, some stores or distributors donâ€™t want to display the price of the product on the website; instead, they want to display the information only so that customers must contact the shop owners to ask the price or may bargain the price of the product. Logicrays has developed the Call for Price Magento 2 extension to hide the product prices and :guilabel:`Add to Cart` button and instead display :guilabel:`Call for Price` or any call to action button.

.. note::
    Hope you are able to successfully install the module.
